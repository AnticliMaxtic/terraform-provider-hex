# hex Provider

The `hex` Terraform provider enables users to perform hexadecimal encoding and decoding operations within their Terraform configurations. This provider is useful for scenarios where you need to convert strings to their hexadecimal representations or decode hexadecimal strings back to their original format, such as when working with APIs, cryptographic keys, or data serialization.

### Features

- Encode plain text strings to hexadecimal format.
- Decode hexadecimal strings to plain text.
- Supports resource and data source operations for flexible integration.
- Useful for managing secrets, identifiers, or any data requiring hex encoding.

### Use Cases

- Preparing data for systems that require hex-encoded input.
- Decoding hex-encoded output from external services.
- Managing cryptographic material in infrastructure as code workflows.

Refer to the resource and data source documentation for specific usage examples and configuration options.

## Example Usage

```terraform
{{ tffile ("examples/provider/provider.tf")}}
